   **Test Scenarios**:
   - **AB Test Management**:
     - *CreateABTestTest.php*: Validates the creation of new A/B tests via POST requests, ensuring correct response statuses and data integrity.
     - *DeleteABTestTest.php*: Ensures proper deletion mechanisms for existing A/B tests, including handling of non-draft and non-existing tests.
     - *FindABTestByIdTest.php*: Tests retrieval of A/B tests by ID, verifying accurate data is returned.
     - *GetAllABTestsTest.php*: Assesses the endpoint responsible for fetching all A/B tests, checking for correct data structures and content.
     - *PublishABTestTest.php*: Validates the publishing process of A/B tests, ensuring state transitions are handled appropriately.
     - *UpdateABTestTest.php*: Tests the update functionality for existing A/B tests, confirming that modifications are correctly applied and persisted.

   These tests serve as practical examples for implementing comprehensive feature testing in Laravel, aiming to enhance application reliability and performance.
 
        
2. **Mini Game Prototype**: A simple 2D puzzle game built with Unity.
    
    - Repository Link (Coming Soon!)
